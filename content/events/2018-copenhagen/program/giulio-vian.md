In this talk, you will hear about the DevOps journey in our company (Glass, Lewis & Co.), from the initial brown-field all-manual state to our current partially automated situation and the strategic destination of a fully automated and monitored process.

In an equilibrium between a high-level view and useful practical tips, we will touch on what informed our decisions, in terms of priorities and technologies, some lessons learned in setting up Infrastructure-as-Code using Terraform for Azure, and how the legacy constraints helped or hindered us on this journey.
