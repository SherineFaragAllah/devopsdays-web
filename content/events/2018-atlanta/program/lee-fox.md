DevOps organizations provide the best operational experiences, right? DevOps organizations provide high quality service and customer satisfaction right? DevOps organizations provide higher value for lower investment, right? Well, the DevOps organizations should throw the best parties.

C.A.L.M.S. provides a foundation to build a solid DevOps shop. However, is that all it’s good for? NO WAY! C.A.L.M.S. can also provide a solid foundation for putting together an event or party. Combine that with some of the underlying motivations of DevOps like Continuous Improvement, and what do you have? Quite simply, a party that everyone can’t wait to attend. PartyOps will talk about leveraging DevOps principals for when we want to let our hair down and rock out, but still feel the need to do it in the most nerdish way we can think of.
