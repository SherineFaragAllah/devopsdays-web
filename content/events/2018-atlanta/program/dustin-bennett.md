In an environment with a strong mix of legacy and cloud native applications, the day-to-day interaction of operations, security, and development varies greatly. Join Dustin and Tom as they paint a picture across several topics, including real world successes and failures along the way. It can be challenging to know what to do and not to do as you start breaking down a legacy monolith and organizational silos. Once you have pieces of an app in the cloud, it is easy to overlook or misunderstand what day 2 really means - you can’t just toss things over the wall and hope for the best. Applications don’t operate in a vacuum, so it is important to understand techniques for negotiating priority for non-functional stories and chores with product owners across the full enterprise.

We have seen devOps practitioners struggle in scaling practices outside of immediate teams and sustain long term. We have each developed software and led teams at Home Depot and ThoughtWorks. We want to share our experiences and insights to better the community.
